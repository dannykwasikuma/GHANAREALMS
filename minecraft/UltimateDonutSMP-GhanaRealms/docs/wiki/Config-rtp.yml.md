### 2. Key Options & Technical Breakdown

| Option / Key Path | Data Type | Allowed Values | Default | Technical Function & Setup Guide |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SETTINGS.PLAYERS-IN-RTP` | `int` | Any valid integer number | `'3'` | Configures the technical `PLAYERS-IN-RTP` parameter for `SETTINGS.PLAYERS-IN-RTP` in `rtp.yml`. |
| `SETTINGS.MAX-ATTEMPTS` | `int` | Any valid integer number | `'64'` | Configures the technical `MAX-ATTEMPTS` parameter for `SETTINGS.MAX-ATTEMPTS` in `rtp.yml`. |
| `SETTINGS.MAX-CHUNK-SAMPLES` | `int` | Any valid integer number | `'128'` | Configures the technical `MAX-CHUNK-SAMPLES` parameter for `SETTINGS.MAX-CHUNK-SAMPLES` in `rtp.yml`. |
| `SETTINGS.ATTEMPT-INTERVAL-TICKS` | `int` | Any valid integer number | `'1'` | Configures the technical `ATTEMPT-INTERVAL-TICKS` parameter for `SETTINGS.ATTEMPT-INTERVAL-TICKS` in `rtp.yml`. |
| `SETTINGS.SEARCH-ATTEMPTS-PER-TICK` | `int` | Any valid integer number | `'4'` | How many candidate locations are checked side by side instead of one after another. Higher values find a spot sooner at the cost of more chunk work per search. |
| `SETTINGS.SEARCH-DISPLAY-MIN-TICKS` | `int` | `0` or higher | `'30'` | How long the searching display is held before the teleport may start, in ticks, where 20 ticks is a second. A search that lands on its first sample would otherwise flash the action bar and teleport in the same breath, so the floor is there to keep the message readable. `0` teleports the moment a spot is found. |
| `SETTINGS.FOUND-DISPLAY-TICKS` | `int` | `0` or higher | `'20'` | How long the found location display is held before the teleport is queued, in ticks. Unlike the setting above this one is paid on every RTP, a teleport served straight from `LOCATION-CACHE` included, so it is the whole wait a player sees when nothing had to be searched for. `0` queues the teleport as soon as the surrounding chunks are ready. |
| `SETTINGS.GENERATE-CHUNKS` | `bool` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Configures the technical `GENERATE-CHUNKS` parameter for `SETTINGS.GENERATE-CHUNKS` in `rtp.yml`. |
| `SETTINGS.GENERATE-FALLBACK-CHUNKS` | `bool` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Configures the technical `GENERATE-FALLBACK-CHUNKS` parameter for `SETTINGS.GENERATE-FALLBACK-CHUNKS` in `rtp.yml`. |
| `SETTINGS.GENERATE-FALLBACK-AFTER-SAMPLES` | `int` | Any valid integer number | `'8'` | Configures the technical `GENERATE-FALLBACK-AFTER-SAMPLES` parameter for `SETTINGS.GENERATE-FALLBACK-AFTER-SAMPLES` in `rtp.yml`. |
| `SETTINGS.MAX-GENERATE-FALLBACK-SAMPLES` | `int` | Any valid integer number | `'32'` | Configures the technical `MAX-GENERATE-FALLBACK-SAMPLES` parameter for `SETTINGS.MAX-GENERATE-FALLBACK-SAMPLES` in `rtp.yml`. |
| `SETTINGS.LOAD-GENERATED-CHUNKS` | `bool` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Whether a search may read terrain that already exists on disk. This is what makes a pregenerated RTP world work while `GENERATE-CHUNKS` stays off. Turning both off leaves the search nothing to read and nothing to make, so every sample comes back empty and the background cache stands down and says so in the console. |
| `SETTINGS.FALLBACK-TO-LOADED-CHUNKS` | `bool` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Configures the technical `FALLBACK-TO-LOADED-CHUNKS` parameter for `SETTINGS.FALLBACK-TO-LOADED-CHUNKS` in `rtp.yml`. |
| `SETTINGS.LOADED-CHUNK-FALLBACK-AFTER-SAMPLES` | `int` | Any valid integer number | `'32'` | Configures the technical `LOADED-CHUNK-FALLBACK-AFTER-SAMPLES` parameter for `SETTINGS.LOADED-CHUNK-FALLBACK-AFTER-SAMPLES` in `rtp.yml`. |
| `SETTINGS.PRELOAD-TELEPORT-CHUNKS` | `bool` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Whether the chunks around the destination are loaded before the teleport lands. On, a player arrives in terrain the server has already read. Off, they teleport straight away and the client catches up, which is faster but can drop them into a hole in the world for a moment. |
| `SETTINGS.PRELOAD-RADIUS` | `int` | `2` to `4` | `'2'` | Chunk radius loaded around the destination. Values below 2 are treated as 2 and anything above 4 as 4. It behaves as a floor rather than a cap: while `POST-TELEPORT-CHUNK-THROTTLE` is on, the radius is raised to the throttled view distance, so with stock settings it lands on 4 no matter what is set here. Turn the throttle off, or lower `POST-TELEPORT-VIEW-DISTANCE`, before this value does anything on its own. |
| `SETTINGS.PRELOAD-CHUNKS-PER-TICK` | `int` | `2` or higher | `'2'` | How many chunks are loaded per tick while preloading. Values below 2 are treated as 2. Higher finishes the warm-up sooner at the cost of more chunk work in a single tick. |
| `SETTINGS.PRELOAD-MAX-TICKS` | `int` | `1` or higher | `'40'` | Preloading gives up after this many ticks so a slow world cannot hold a teleport open forever. It is raised automatically when the radius and the per-tick rate need longer than this to get through every chunk, so lowering it does not truncate a warm-up that was going to finish. |
| `SETTINGS.POST-TELEPORT-CHUNK-THROTTLE` | `bool` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Whether a player is held at a shorter view and simulation distance for a moment after an RTP. It spreads the cost of sending brand new terrain instead of rendering all of it at once. Also raises the preload radius, as described above. |
| `SETTINGS.POST-TELEPORT-VIEW-DISTANCE` | `int` | `2` or higher | `'4'` | View distance a player is held at while the throttle is on. It only lowers a player's distance and never raises it, so a client already below this value is left alone. Values below 2 are treated as 2. |
| `SETTINGS.POST-TELEPORT-SIMULATION-DISTANCE` | `int` | `2` or higher | `'4'` | Simulation distance a player is held at while the throttle is on, under the same rules as the view distance above. |
| `SETTINGS.POST-TELEPORT-THROTTLE-TICKS` | `int` | `20` or higher | `'80'` | How long the throttled distances are kept before the player's own settings are handed back. Values below 20 are treated as 20. |
| `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE` | `section` | See `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE` below | See example | Keeps safe locations ready in the background so `/rtp` can teleport without running a search first. |

## Section: `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE`

Finding a safe spot is the slow part of `/rtp`, and on a large overworld it can keep a player waiting
for the best part of a minute. This cache does that work in the background, so the command
usually has a verified location waiting for it and teleports straight away.

Filling starts with the server and keeps going whether or not anyone is online, which is the point:
the first player to join should not be the one who pays for the search. What it will not do is fill
in a hurry. Exactly one background search runs at a time across the whole server, it takes the
worlds in turn, it waits a few seconds between searches, and it uses fewer parallel checks than a
search a player is waiting on. A search that has not finished within thirty seconds is stopped
outright rather than left running beside its replacement.

By default the warm-up never generates terrain, even when `SETTINGS.GENERATE-CHUNKS` is on for
players. It fills from chunks that already exist and skips anything that would have to be made. That
is the safe setting and it is why the cache costs almost nothing on a pregenerated world.

Turning `LOCATION-CACHE.GENERATE-CHUNKS` on lifts that restriction, and it is the one option here
that can cost real memory. Generating for a player who asked is a short burst; generating in the
background happens over and over on a world nobody has walked yet, and on a small box that adds up
fast. Leave it off unless your RTP area is already generated or you know you have the memory to
spare. If you want a cache on a brand new world and your server can take it, this is the switch.

Each entry is re-checked against the current world and radius before it is handed out, and a search
only starts when a world is short of ready locations. When the cache is empty the command falls back
to searching live, exactly as before.

A world with no generated terrain inside its RTP radius has nothing for the warm-up to find, and
retrying cannot change that. So a world that comes back empty is warned about once and then waited
on for longer and longer, up to ten minutes, rather than being searched again every few seconds. The
wait belongs to that world alone, so a world that is fine keeps its normal pace, and the first
location a backed-off world produces puts it straight back to normal too. If `LOAD-GENERATED-CHUNKS`
and `LOCATION-CACHE.GENERATE-CHUNKS` are both off there is no way to reach a chunk at all, and the
warm-up says which one to turn on instead of searching.

### 1. Commented Setup Code Example

```yaml
  # Safe locations found ahead of time in the background so RTP can teleport without searching
  LOCATION-CACHE:
    # Enable or disable the background safe location cache
    ENABLED: true
    # How many ready locations are kept per RTP world. 0 disables the cache
    SIZE: 3
    # Seconds a cached location stays usable before it is thrown away. 0 keeps it until the next reload
    MAX-AGE-SECONDS: 600
    # Let the background warm-up generate new terrain. Keep false unless your RTP area is pregenerated
    # or the server has memory to spare, since generating in the background runs far more often than
    # generating for one player who asked. Independent of SETTINGS.GENERATE-CHUNKS above
    GENERATE-CHUNKS: false
```

### 2. Key Options & Technical Breakdown

| Option / Key Path | Data Type | Allowed Values | Default | Technical Function & Setup Guide |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE.ENABLED` | `bool` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Master toggle. When `false` every `/rtp` searches for a location the moment the player runs it. |
| `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE.SIZE` | `int` | `0` to `16` | `'3'` | Ready locations kept per RTP world. Raise it on a busy server so back to back teleports stay instant, lower it to spend less time searching in the background. `0` turns the cache off. |
| `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE.MAX-AGE-SECONDS` | `int` | Any valid integer number | `'600'` | How long a cached location may sit unused before it is discarded and searched again. `0` keeps entries until the next reload. |
| `SETTINGS.LOCATION-CACHE.GENERATE-CHUNKS` | `bool` | `true`, `false` | `false` | Whether the background warm-up may generate terrain. Separate from `SETTINGS.GENERATE-CHUNKS`, which only covers searches a player asked for. Off means the cache fills from terrain that already exists and costs almost nothing. On means it can fill a world nobody has walked yet, at the price of generating chunks around the clock. |

### 3. Practical Setup Example

Keep more spots ready on a busy server and refresh them more often:

```yaml
SETTINGS:
  LOCATION-CACHE:
    ENABLED: true
    SIZE: 8
    MAX-AGE-SECONDS: 300
```

Fill the cache on a world that has never been generated, on a server with memory to spare:

```yaml
SETTINGS:
  GENERATE-CHUNKS: true
  LOCATION-CACHE:
    ENABLED: true
    SIZE: 3
    GENERATE-CHUNKS: true
```

Watch your memory the first time you run that pairing. If it climbs and does not settle, put
`LOCATION-CACHE.GENERATE-CHUNKS` back to `false` and pregenerate the area instead.

Turn the cache off entirely and go back to searching on demand:

```yaml
SETTINGS:
  LOCATION-CACHE:
    ENABLED: false
```

---

## Section: `SETTINGS.RANK-COOLDOWNS`

Per-rank `/rtp` cooldowns resolved from permissions, so different ranks can have different cooldowns
without a separate config entry per rank.

### 1. Commented Setup Code Example

```yaml
  # Per-rank RTP cooldown overrides resolved from permissions
  RANK-COOLDOWNS:
    # Enable or disable permission based RTP cooldown overrides
    ENABLED: true
    # Explicit mapping from permission node to RTP cooldown in seconds
    # Players can also be given ultimatedonutsmp.rtp.cooldown.<seconds> directly, for example
    # ultimatedonutsmp.rtp.cooldown.3 for a 3 second cooldown
    # The lowest value the player has wins, and 0 removes the cooldown entirely
    # Players without any of these permissions keep the per-world COOLDOWN below
    PERMISSIONS:
      "ultimatedonutsmp.rtp.cooldown.vip++": 3
      "ultimatedonutsmp.rtp.cooldown.vip+": 10
      "ultimatedonutsmp.rtp.cooldown.vip": 15
```

### 2. Key Options & Technical Breakdown

| Option / Key Path | Data Type | Allowed Values | Default | Technical Function & Setup Guide |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `SETTINGS.RANK-COOLDOWNS.ENABLED` | `bool` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Master toggle. When `false` every player uses the per-world `WORLD-SETTINGS.<world>.COOLDOWN` value and all cooldown permissions are ignored. |
| `SETTINGS.RANK-COOLDOWNS.PERMISSIONS` | `section` | Permission node to seconds | See example | Maps an arbitrary permission node to an RTP cooldown in seconds. Use this to reuse rank nodes you already have instead of adding numeric nodes. |

### 3. Resolution Order

1. Every entry under `PERMISSIONS` the player holds is collected.
2. Every `ultimatedonutsmp.rtp.cooldown.<seconds>` node the player holds is collected. A non-numeric or
   negative suffix is ignored.
3. The **lowest** collected value becomes the player cooldown, so stacked ranks always give the player
   the fastest cooldown they are entitled to.
4. If the player holds none of these nodes, the per-world `WORLD-SETTINGS.<world>.COOLDOWN` value applies.

A permission value fully replaces the per-world value, in both directions. `ultimatedonutsmp.rtp.cooldown.60`
gives a 60 second cooldown even where the world is configured at 30, and `ultimatedonutsmp.rtp.cooldown.0`
removes the cooldown entirely.

The cooldown is evaluated on every `/rtp` attempt rather than frozen when the previous teleport finished,
so a rank change applies immediately, including to a cooldown already counting down.

### 4. Practical Setup Example

Give the default rank a 60 second cooldown, VIP 15 seconds and staff no cooldown at all:

```yaml
SETTINGS:
  RANK-COOLDOWNS:
    ENABLED: true
    PERMISSIONS:
      "group.vip": 15
      "group.staff": 0

WORLD-SETTINGS:
  world:
    COOLDOWN: 60
```

Or skip the config entirely and drive it from LuckPerms alone:

```
/lp group default permission set ultimatedonutsmp.rtp.cooldown.60
/lp group vip permission set ultimatedonutsmp.rtp.cooldown.15
/lp group staff permission set ultimatedonutsmp.rtp.cooldown.0
```

The `{cooldown}` placeholder in the RTP menu shows the viewing player their own resolved cooldown.

---

## Section: `QUEUE`

### 1. Commented Setup Code Example

```yaml
# Matchmaking queue in front of RTP. Players run /rtpq to wait for other players, and the whole
# group is dropped at one shared random location instead of at a random location each
QUEUE:
  # Enable or disable the RTP matchmaking queue and the /rtpq command (true / false)
  ENABLED: true
  # How many players have to be waiting before the group is teleported
  MATCH-SIZE: 2
  # World the matched group is teleported into
  WORLD: world
  # How far the matched players are scattered around the shared location, in blocks.
  # 0 drops the whole group on the exact same block
  SPREAD-RADIUS: 16
  # Cuboid that feeds the queue on its own. Standing anywhere inside it puts a player in the
  # queue without typing /rtpq, and walking back out takes them off it again. Leave empty to
  # keep the command as the only way in. Bind it in game with
  # /cuboid bind <cuboid> rtp-queue true
  CUBOID: ''
```

### 2. Key Options & Technical Breakdown

| Option / Key Path | Data Type | Allowed Values | Default | Technical Function & Setup Guide |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `QUEUE.ENABLED` | `bool` | `true`, `false` | `true` | Turns the matchmaking queue and the `/rtpq` command on or off. The queue also follows the global `ENABLED` toggle above, so switching RTP off switches the queue off with it. |
| `QUEUE.MATCH-SIZE` | `int` | `2` - `32` | `2` | How many players have to be waiting before a match fires. Values below 2 are read as 2 and values above 32 are read as 32. |
| `QUEUE.WORLD` | `string` | Any RTP world name or menu id | `world` | Where matched groups are sent. The name is resolved the same way `/rtp <world>` resolves it, and the world needs its own `WORLD-SETTINGS` entry. |
| `QUEUE.SPREAD-RADIUS` | `int` | `0` - `512` | `16` | How far apart the group is scattered around the shared location. Each player after the first gets their own safe-location search inside this radius, and `0` drops everyone on the exact same block. |
| `QUEUE.CUBOID` | `string` | Any cuboid name | `''` | A region that queues players by itself. Anyone standing inside is put on the queue about a second after walking in, and taken back off it on the way out. Leave it empty and `/rtpq` stays the only way in. `/cuboid bind <cuboid> rtp-queue true` writes the name here for you. |
| `QUEUE.MESSAGES.*` | `string` | Any coloured text | see below | Player feedback for joining, leaving, and being matched. |

The queue deliberately ignores RTP cooldowns, playtime requirements and the `PLAYERS-IN-RTP`
slot limit, the same way the respawn teleport does, because a match has to move everybody at
once. It also skips the stand-still countdown: one player stepping sideways would otherwise
cancel their half of the match and leave the rest alone in the wilderness.

The cuboid only takes back out the players it queued itself, so somebody who ran `/rtpq` before
walking through keeps their place. Give it a region of its own rather than reusing
`RTP-ZONE.CUBOID` from `config.yml`: that one runs a countdown and sends every player somewhere
different, which is the opposite of what a match is for.

### 3. Practical Setup Example

```yaml
QUEUE:
  ENABLED: true
  # Three players per match, dropped within 30 blocks of each other in the nether
  MATCH-SIZE: 3
  WORLD: world_nether
  SPREAD-RADIUS: 30
  # Players queue by walking into the pit at spawn instead of typing anything
  CUBOID: rtp_pit
```

---

## Section: `QUEUE.MESSAGES`

### 1. Commented Setup Code Example

```yaml
  # User feedback for the matchmaking queue
  MESSAGES:
    DISABLED: '&cThe RTP queue is currently disabled.'
    UNAVAILABLE: '&cThe RTP queue is not available right now.'
    BUSY: '&cFinish the teleport you already started before joining the RTP queue.'
    JOINED: '&e[RTP Queue] &fYou have joined the queue. Waiting for another player... &7({waiting}/{needed})'
    PLAYER-JOINED: '&e[RTP Queue] &f{player} has joined the queue. &7({waiting}/{needed})'
    ALREADY-QUEUED: '&cYou are already in the RTP queue at position #{position}.'
    LEFT: '&e[RTP Queue] &fYou have left the queue.'
    PLAYER-LEFT: '&e[RTP Queue] &f{player} has left the queue. &7({waiting}/{needed})'
    NOT-QUEUED: '&cYou are not in the RTP queue.'
    MATCH-FOUND: '&a[RTP Queue] &fMatch found! Teleporting you to the same area...'
    MATCH-FAILED: '&c[RTP Queue] &fNo safe location was found for the match, so you are back in the queue.'
    MATCH-ABANDONED: '&c[RTP Queue] &fThe other players left before the match started, so you are back in the queue.'
```

| `PLAYER-LEFT` | `{player}`, `{waiting}`, `{needed}` | Sent to everyone still waiting when somebody leaves. |
| `NOT-QUEUED` | none | `/rtpq leave` is used by a player who is not in the queue. |
| `MATCH-FOUND` | none | The queue fills and the search for the shared location starts. |
| `MATCH-FAILED` | none | No safe location was found, and the group goes back into the queue. |
| `MATCH-ABANDONED` | none | Too many of the matched players disconnected before the teleport. |

Setting any message to an empty string silences it without disabling the behaviour behind it.
